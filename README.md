aichat
=======

Uses the ALICE AIML to run a chatbot in Flask.

Inspired by/based on [Justin Huang's chatbot](https://github.com/jstnhuang/chatbot). Which in turn uses:

> Speech recognition uses the [Web Speech API](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html) in Chrome.

> [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is used to run a simple web server.

> The chatbot is based on the free [Alice AIML](https://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-foundation-alice/) set.

> Google Translate is unofficially used to synthesize voices from text. [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) is used to convert the sound file.
